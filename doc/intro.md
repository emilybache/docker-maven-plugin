## Introduction 

It focuses on two major aspects:

* **Building** and **pushing** Docker images which contains build artifacts
* **Starting** and **stopping** Docker containers for integration
  testing and development 

Docker *images* are the central entity which can be configured. 
Containers on the other hand are more or less volatil. They are
created and destroyed on the fly from the configured images and are
completely managed internally.

### Building docker images

One purpose of this plugin is to create docker images holding the
actual application. This can be done with the `docker:build` goal.  It
is easy to include build artifacts and their dependencies into an
image. Therefor this plugin uses the
[assembly descriptor format](http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-assembly-plugin/assembly.html)
from the
[maven-assembly-plugin](http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-assembly-plugin/)
for specifying the content which will be added below a directory in
the image (`/maven` by default). Image which are build with this
plugin can be also pushed to public or private registries with
`docker:push`.

### Running containers

With this plugin it is possible to run completely isolated integration
tests so you don't need to take care of shared resources. Ports can be
mapped dynamically and made available as Maven properties to your
integration test code. 

Multiple containers can be managed at once which can be linked
together or share data via volumes. Containers are created and started
with the `docker:start` goal and stopped and destroyed with the
`docker:stop` goal. For integrations tests both goals are typically
bound to the the `pre-integration-test` and `post-integration-test`,
respectively. It is recommended to use the `maven-failsafe-plugin` for
integration testing in order to stop the docker container even when
the tests are failing.

For proper isolation container exposed ports can be dynamically and
flexibly mapped to local host ports. It is easy to specify a Maven
property which will be filled in with a dynamically assigned port
after a container has been started and which can then be used as
parameter for integration tests to connect to the application.

### Configuration

You can use a single configuration for all goals (in fact, that's the
recommended way). The configuration contains a general part and a list
of image specific configuration, one for each image. 

The general part contains global configuration like the Docker URL or
the path to the SSL certificates for communication with the Docker Host.

Then, each image configuration has three parts:

* A general part containing the image's name and alias.
* A `<build>` configuration specifying how images are build.
* A `<run>` configuration telling how container should be created and started.

Either `<build>` or `<run>` can be also omitted.

Let's have a look at a plugin configuration example:

````xml
<configuration>
  <images>
    <image>
      <alias>service</alias>
      <name>jolokia/docker-demo:${project.version}</name>

      <build>
         <from>java:8</from>
         <assemblyDescriptor>docker-assembly.xml</assemblyDescriptor>
         <ports>
           <port>8080</port>
         </ports>
         <command>java -jar /maven/service.jar</command>
      </build>

      <run>
         <ports>
           <port>tomcat.port:8080</port>
         </ports>
         <wait>
           <url>http://localhost:${tomcat.port}/access</url>
           <time>10000</time>
         </wait>
         <links>
           <link>database:db</link>
         </links>
       </run>
    </image>

    <image>
      <alias>database</alias>
      <name>postgres:9</name>
      <run>
        <wait>
          <log>database system is ready to accept connections</log>
          <time>20000</time>
        </wait>
      </run>
    </image>
  </images>
</configuration>
````

Here two images are specified. One is the official PostgreSQL 9 image from
Docker Hub, which internally can be referenced as "*database*" (`<alias>`). It
only has a `<run>` section which declares that the startup should wait
until the given text pattern is matched in the log output. Next is a
"*service*" image, which is specified in its `<build>` section. It
creates an image which has artifacts and dependencies in the
`/maven` directory (and which are specified with an assembly
descriptor). Additionally it specifies the startup command for the
container which in this example fires up a microservices from a jar
file just copied over via the assmebly descriptor. Also it exposes
port 8080. In the `<run>` section this port is dynamically mapped to a
port out of the Docker range 49000 ... 49900 and then assigned to the
Maven property `${jolokia.port}`. This property could be used for an
integration test to access this micro service. An important part is
the `<links>` section which tells that the image aliased "*database*" is
linked into the "*service*" container, which can access the internal
ports in the usual Docker way (via environments variables prefixed
with `DB_`). 

Images can be specified in any order, the plugin will take care of the
proper startup order (and will bail out in case of circular
dependencies). 

### Other highlights

Some other highlights in random order (and not complete):

* Auto pulling of images (with progress indicator)
* Waiting for a container to startup based on time, the reachability
  of an URL or a pattern in the log output
* Support for SSL authentication (since Docker 1.3)
* Specification of encrypted registry passwords for push and pull in
  `~/.m2/settings.xml` (i.e. outside the `pom.xml`)
* Color output ;-)

### Why another Maven Plugin ?

If you search it GitHub you will find a whole cosmos of Maven Docker
plugins (November 2014: 12 (!) plugins which 4 actively maintained
). On the one hand, variety is a good thing on the other hand for
users it is hard to decide which one to choose. So, you might wonder
why you should choose this one.

I setup a dedicated
[shootout project](https://github.com/rhuss/shootout-docker-maven)
which compares the four most active plugins. It contains a simple demo
project with a database and microservice image and an integration
test. Each plugin is configured to create images and run the
integration test (if possible). Although it might be a bit biased, I
think its a good decision help for finding out which plugin suites you
best.

But here is my motivation for writing this plugin. 

First of all, you might wonder, why I started this plugin if there
were already quite some out here ?

The reason is quite simple: I didn't knew them when I started and if
you look at the commit history you will see that they all started
their life roughly at the same time (March 2014).

My design goals where quite simple and here are my initial needs for
this plugin:

* I needed a flexible, **dynamic port mapping** from container to host
  ports so that truly isolated build can be achieved. This should
  work on indirect setups with VMs like
  [boot2docker](https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker) for
  running on OS X.

* It should be possible to **pull images** on the fly to get
  self-contained and repeatable builds with the only requirement to
  have docker installed.

* The configuration of the plugin should be **simple** since usually
  developers don't want to dive into specific Docker details only to
  start a container. So, only a handful options should be exposed
  which needs not necessarily map directly to docker config setup.

* The plugin should play nicely with
  [Cargo](http://cargo.codehaus.org/) so that deployments into
  containers can be easy.

* I want as **less dependencies** as possible for this plugin. So I
  decided to *not* use the Java Docker API
  [docker-java](https://github.com/docker-java/docker-java) which is
  external to docker and has a different lifecycle than Docker's
  [remote API](http://docs.docker.io/en/latest/reference/api/docker_remote_api/).
  That is probably the biggest difference to the other
  docker-maven-plugins since AFAIK they all rely on this API. Since
  for this plugin I really need only a small subset of the whole API,
  I think it is ok to do the REST calls directly. That way I only have
  to deal with Docker peculiarities and not also with docker-java's
  one. As a side effect this plugin has less transitive dependencies.
  FYI: There are now yet other Docker Java/Groovy client libraries out, which
  might be used for plugins like this, too:
  [fabric/fabric-docker-api](https://github.com/fabric8io/fabric8/tree/master/fabric/fabric-docker-api),
  [sprotify/docker-client](https://github.com/spotify/docker-client)
  or
  [gesellix-docker/docker-client](https://github.com/gesellix-docker/docker-client).
  Can you see the pattern ;-) ?
  
So, final words: Enjoy this plugin, and please use the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/rhuss/docker-maven-plugin/issues)
for anything what hurts or when you have a wish list. I'm quite
committed to this plugin and have quite some plans. Please stay tuned
